# How to Install Learn Locally!

## Overview/Knowledge and Understanding
The Learn IDE is absolutely wonderful for beginner programmers. It abstracts away use of important tools like Version Control and Ruby Version Manager, or prosaic actions like bash commands and prompts with the hopes of allowing the user to simply focus on learning the language and concepts necessary to level up as a developer.  Its like having training wheels on your intro to dev learning experience!  That said, the tools and paradigms abstracted away by the IDE are items that are very much part of every developers life!  The training wheels must come off! We not only need to learn how to install our own local environment, we also need to learn about the very important tools that you we use everyday in our roles as software engineers.

## Misconceptions and Difficult Concepts
Some difficult concepts tend to be:
1. Version Control (especially as it relates to Github).
2. Traversing a machine's directories only using Terminal prompts.
3. Package and language managers at large.
4. etcetera
